      <h2> What is abstract art? </h2>
      <h4>“Abstract art is art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality. 
          The term can be applied to art that is based on an object, figure or landscape, where forms have been 
          simplified or schematised. It is also applied to art that uses forms, such as geometric shapes or gestural marks, 
          which have no source at all in an external visual reality.” - Tate, British Art Museum </h4>
