      <h1> Modern Art</h1>
      <h2> What is modern art? </h2>
      <h4>Modern art is an art movement that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
          It was characterized by a shift away from traditional styles to a more abstract, experimental approach to 
          creating works of art. Major modern art movements include Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, 
          Dadaism and Surrealism. Influential modernist artists include Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Salvador Dal√≠ and 
          Marcel Duchamp. Modern artwork has had a lasting impact on the development of visual culture and continues to 
          influence contemporary art today.</h4>

            <h3> Florida Reflection by Erin Hanson</h3>
            <p> These turquoise waters were inspired by a sunset in Clearwater, Florida. The Florida palms in the foreground draw you into the vista of 
              clouds and reflected color. Each brush stroke is placed with free, confident motion, without overlapping, 
              in the Open Impressionism style.</p>

            <h3>Lemon Blooms by Erin Hanson</h3>
            <p> Yellow flowers bloom in an abundance of sunny color during a desert super bloom. This painting captures 
              the desert wildflowers at Borrego Springs, in southern California. Erin Hanson applies impasto brush strokes of 
              oil paint are laid side by side, without overlapping, in her signature technique of Open Impressionism, 
              creating a mosaic of color and texture across the canvas with her brush.</p>

            <h3> Three Sisters by Erin Hanson</h3>
            <p> Oregon's Cascade mountain range is famous for its Three Sisters peaks, which can be seen from Bend to Sisters, Oregon. 
              This painting captures the soft dawn light on a clear summer morning in June. The thickly applied, impressionistic brush 
              strokes capture the transient light of the scene.</p>
